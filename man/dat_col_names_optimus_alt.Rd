\title{Title: A function to obtain attribute names for experimental samples}
\usage{
dat_col_names_optimus_alt(
  df,
  rows_used = NULL,
  cols_used = NULL,
  user_specific_labels = NULL,
  read_direction = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A clean data frame obtained from the large scale delineation of samples.}

\item{rows_used}{A character vector representing the plate rows used; eg ru <- c('A','B','C'). can be used in sequence or out of sequence.}

\item{cols_used}{A numeric vector representing the plate columns used; eg cu <- c(1,2,3,4). keep as null if all the columns were used or columns are used in sequence.}

\item{user_specific_labels}{A character vector with specific sample labels based on the plate setup}

\item{read_direction}{User can leave null (vertical) for machine up-down read OR 'horizontal' for machine left-right read}
}
\value{
Returns column names that will be added to the normalized data frame that contains all samples
}
\description{
The function takes a clean data frame, data on the experiment and returns the column names that match the FLUOstar plate reader.
}
\note{
This function is a subordinate function and follows a sequence of actions. In this package, this function cannot be used as a standalone.
Also, some work is needed here on the part of the user because i have no access to their setup file.
A function that takes the setup excel file from the user should be part of the next update to prevent the user from doing much work.
The program is always going to need rows_used. The user can choose to specify columns used but typically if things are in sequence then everything should be fine.
The extreme case is an extreme unorthodox plate (hard to know when this will happen) and then the user must either specify rows used directly or the user is given a prompt by R to input rows used.
