\title{Title: The root function that returns a normalized data frame with the Cycle No ready for analysis}
\usage{
normfluodat(
  dat,
  tnp,
  cycles,
  rows_used = NULL,
  cols_used = NULL,
  user_specific_labels = NULL,
  read_direction = NULL
)

normfluodat(
  dat,
  tnp,
  cycles,
  rows_used = NULL,
  cols_used = NULL,
  user_specific_labels = NULL,
  read_direction = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{directory to the users FLUOstar dat file}

\item{tnp}{Stands for test,negative,positive (sample types); the number should match the number of sample types in the plate reader even if repeating a sample type}

\item{cycles}{The number of cycles chosen by the researcher. In the case of this package 40 is the standard but ensure to have the right number of samples}

\item{rows_used}{A character vector of the rows used, eg n = c('A','B','C')}

\item{cols_used}{A numeric vector of the columns used, eg m = c(2,4,6)}

\item{user_specific_labels}{A character vector with specific sample labels based on the plate setup}

\item{read_direction}{User can leave null for machine up-down read OR 'horizontal' for machine left-right read}
}
\value{
A normalized data frame with the x-variable (Cycle_No), ready for analysis

A normalized data frame with the x-variable (Cycle_No), ready for analysis
}
\description{
Input a dat file (dat file directory) and required parameters and BOOM the researcher has a normalized data frame ripe and ready for clean analysis

\note{
This is the MAIN function and stands alone but is dependent on the subordinate functions. If the user understands what they are doing this is all they need.
The user should use the user_specific_labels parameter for naming variables if they have an extreme unorthodox experimental setup.
