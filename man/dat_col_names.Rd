\title{Title: A function to obtain attribute names for experimental samples}
\usage{
dat_col_names(df, rows_used = NULL, cols_used = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A clean data frame obtained from the large scale delineation of samples.}

\item{rows_used}{A character vector representing the plate rows used; eg ru <- c('A','B','C')}

\item{cols_used}{A numeric vector representing the plate columns used; eg cu <- c(1,2,3,4). keep as null if all the columns were used.}
}
\value{
Returns column names that will be added to the normalized data frame that contains all samples
}
\description{
The function takes a clean data frame, data on the experiment and returns the column names that match the FLUOstar plate reader.
}
\note{
This function is a subordinate function and follows a sequence of actions. In this package, this function cannot be used as a standalone.
Also, some work is needed here on the part of the user because i have no access to their setup file.
A function that takes the setup excel file from the user should be part of the next update to prevent the user from doing much work.

fpath <- system.file("extdata", "dat_1.dat", package = "normfluodbf", mustWork = TRUE)
dat_df <- read.table(file=fpath)
comma_dat <- clean_odddat(dat_df)

n = c('A','B','C')
sample_col_names <- dat_col_names(resampled_scaled, n , cols_used = NULL) # i used all columns so col_used = NULL
