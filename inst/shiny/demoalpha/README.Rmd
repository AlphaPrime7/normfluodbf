- normfluodbf_ShinyApp is to an extension of the normfluodbf package.

#Updates and maintainace 
- There is an update coming for the multiplot 
- There is an update coming for QC on choosing samples

# How to Use the App

- For now open the DBF_Wrangler.R file and run the functions so that they are part of your R environment.
- I will say just run all the functions, but if you initially open the app it will also point you to the needed functions.
- I am writing this late and a little busy with finding work and working on another project so these will be placeholder directions.
- I will organize the needed functions later.
- For anyone who has tried using the app and failed (especially R newbies) I will be here to ensure that it is a seamless process so better instructions forthcoming.
- Also a more polished version of the app will be hosted on the cloud.
- This post is coming late at night given that I am just now taking in and accepting the possibility that truly ~ 1000 scientists might be using this package that was built from a pain point i experienced as a PhD student.
- More to come on this package with updates and functionality to work with dat files.
