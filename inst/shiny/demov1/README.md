\#Updates and maintainace - There is an update coming for the

# How to Use the App

- For now open the DBF_Wrangler.R file and run the functions so that
  they are part of your R environment.
- I will say just run all the functions, but if you initially open the
  app it will also point you to the needed functions.
- I am writing this late and a little busy with finding work and working
  on another project so these will be placeholder directions.
- I will organize the needed functions later.
- For anyone who has tried using the app and failed (especially R
  newbies) I will be here to ensure that it is a seamless process so
  better instructions forthcoming.
- Also a more polished version of the app will be hosted on the cloud.
- This post is coming late at night given that I am just now taking in
  and accepting the possibility that truly ~ 1000 scientists might be
  using this package that was built from a pain point i experienced as a
  PhD student.
- More to come on this package with updates and functionality to work
  with dat files.
