# normfluodbf

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of normfluodbf is to normalize fluorescence data obtained from
liposome flux assay experiments via the FLUOstar microplate reader.
Input or source file is a .dbf file that is not ready for analysis
without processing through normfluodbf. There is a ShinyApp for this as
well.

## Installation

You can install the development version of normfluodbf from
[GitHub](https://github.com/AlphaPrime7/normfluodbf) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AlphaPrime7/normfluodbf")

#Once the package makes CRAN
install.packages("normfluodbf")
library(normfluodbf)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
normalized_data <- normfluodbf("liposomes_214.dbf")
```

## R packages used

-   tidyr
-   data.table
-   foreign
