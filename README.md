# ‚è© üìΩÔ∏è Quick start

For quick starters, please visit the
[`{video tutorial}`](https://alphaprime7.github.io/normfluodbf/video.html)
for an illustration on how to effectively use the package. The video
tutorial only covers DAT files based on the assumption that MOST users
will be interested in using the package for DAT files.

## üÜï Updates

Based on work by [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali), I have
added functionalities for a plate like setup that ensures that R users
have a better experience dealing with Liposome flux assay data sets.
Adding the plate system ensures that R users can get plots similar to
that seen on the Microplate reader. I can go on forever on the
advantages of adding the plate system but R users will have to use it
and find out the benefits for themselves.

[Dean Attali‚Äôs](https://github.com/daattali)
[ddpcr](https://github.com/daattali/ddpcr/tree/master) provides an
excellent implementation of the plate system but in the context of
Digital Droplet Polymerase Chain Reactions (Ddpcr); I extend Dean‚Äôs work
into Normfluodbf in the context of Liposome Flux Assays. I include
advanced plotting functions in this update to ensure that scientists can
perform science and let worries of data analysis to Normfluodbf. I hope
that has been achieved in this update and hope to be even better in
subsequent updates.

In regards to plate systems, future updates might involve a change to
the plate system in this package in order to achieve a more universal
plate system that can be used to make plates that work with Dean‚Äôs
[ddpcr](https://github.com/daattali/ddpcr/tree/master) experiments and
other experiments that utilize plates.

Caveat: The shiny app that was initially developed will be added to this
package post-publication of the update. Due to unforeseen circumstances
and because I have been working on real work, there has not been enough
time to add the simple non-styled app that was developed for this
package in my rookie days. Shiny app functions will not yield a useful
shiny App. COMING SOON‚Ä¶

# ‚úçÔ∏è Introduction

[`{normfluodbf}`](https://github.com/AlphaPrime7/normfluodbf) is used to
clean and normalize DBF and DAT files obtained from liposome flux assay
(LFA) experiments performed with the FLUOstar microplate reader. The
expectation is this package is not limited to this assay type but other
assay types performed with the same instrument. The final data frames
obtained from this package are ready for insightful data analysis and
for the creation of amazing visuals (using ggplot2) that help in making
scientific deductions or making presentations to project stakeholders.
This project firmly represents my core belief in the public
dissemination of scientific information. My convictions on this idea of
public dissemination were driven by the book ‚ÄúWhat Mad Pursuit‚Äù by
Francis Crick. Visit
[`{my page}`](https://alphaprime7.github.io/normfluodbf/articles/normfluodbf.html)
for details on the concept behind the project.

# üïµÔ∏è Use Scenarios

## üß≠ DBF Files Case-Study <img src="man/figures/dbf.png" align="right" width="40"/>

- Here examples are presented on how this package handles DBF files.

### Backward Compatible Function

- This methodology is grandfathered for initial adopters of normfluodbf.
- Package illustration with DBF files:

``` r
#library(normfluodbf)
liposomes_214 <- system.file("extdata", "liposomes_214.dbf", package = "normfluodbf")
normalized_data <- norm_tidy_dbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'hundred')
```

### New Function

- This next methodology provides easier syntax and I prefer this
  function name over the function name above.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
liposomes_214 <- system.file("extdata", "liposomes_214.dbf", package = "normfluodbf")
normalized_data <- normfluordbf(liposomes_214)
normalized_data <- normfluordbf(liposomes_214)
```

### Advanced Features Illustration

- The next section elaborates on the new features added for handling DBF
  files.

### DBF Normalization Procedures

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
liposomes_214 <- system.file("extdata", "liposomes_214.dbf", package = "normfluodbf")
normalized_data <- norm_tidy_dbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'one')
normalized_data100 <- norm_tidy_dbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'hundred')
normalized_dataz <- norm_tidy_dbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'z-score')

# The user can add a transformation parameter
normalized_datazt <- norm_tidy_dbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'z-score', transformed = 'log')
```

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
liposomes_214 <- system.file("extdata", "liposomes_214.dbf", package = "normfluodbf")
normalized_data <- normfluordbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'one')
normalized_data100 <- normfluordbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'hundred')
normalized_dataz <- normfluordbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'z-score')

# The user can add a transformation parameter
normalized_datazt <- normfluordbf(liposomes_214, norm_scale = 'z-score', transformed = 'log')
```

## üß≠ DAT Files Case-Study <img src="man/figures/dat.png" align="right" width="40"/>

### Advanced Function

- This methodology was provided as a minor update in normfluodbf 1.5.2.
- This update was significantly bigger than expected and should have
  been a major update but by definition when backward compatibility is
  maintained with the previous version, it should be considered a minor
  update.
- These three parameters are a MUST for this function to work.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
dat1 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_1.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat1, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, rows_used = c('A','B','C'), interval = 30)
```

### Base Function

- This next methodology is the base version of the function above. This
  methodology has less features than the function above.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
dat2 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_2.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
normalized_data <- normfluordat(dat2, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, rows_used = c('A','B','C'))
```

- Please note that the examples above indicate the simplest scenarios as
  these functions have more features than presented in here.

### DAT Advanced Procedures

- The next sections elaborate on the built-in features for handling DAT
  files.

#### Using The rows_used parameter

- This parameter is used alone and the user need not worry about
  providing the columns used.
- The default read direction is vertical.
- The program has a robust algorithm or recipe for determining attribute
  names based on the rows used.
- Users are strongly encouraged to provide the rows_used parameter.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
dat2 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_2.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
n <- c('A','B','C') #rows used

# Cycle_Number attribute is included below
normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat2, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, n)

# Cycle_Number & Time attributes are included below
normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat2, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, n, interval = 30)
```

- Pay attention to the illustrations below. The setup below represents a
  standard experimental setup.

| Sample_Type (TNP) | 96  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
|:------------------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| Test              | A   | X1  | X2  | X3  | X4  | X5  | X6  | X7  | X8  | X9  | X10 | X11 | X12 |
| Negative          | B   | X13 | X14 | X15 | X16 | X17 | X18 | X19 | X20 | X21 | X22 | X23 | X24 |
| Positive          | C   | X25 | X26 | X27 | X28 | X29 | X30 | X31 | X32 | X33 | X34 | X35 | X36 |
|                   | D   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | E   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | F   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | G   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | H   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

- The default or vertical read direction means the final data frame is
  presented in the format below.

| A1 (Test) | B1 (Negative) | C1 (Positive) | Cycle_No |
|:----------|:--------------|:--------------|:---------|
| A1        | B1            | C1            | 1        |
| A1        | B1            | C1            | 2        |
| A1        | B1            | C1            | 3        |
| A1        | B1            | C1            | 4        |
| A1        | B1            | C1            | 5        |
| A1        | B1            | C1            | 6        |
| A1        | B1            | C1            | ‚Ä¶38      |
| A1        | B1            | C1            | ‚Ä¶39      |
| A1        | B1            | C1            | ‚Ä¶40      |

#### Using The rows_used and cols_used parameter

- The cols_used parameter is only used if the user suspects some
  inconsistencies in their experimental procedure. Otherwise, the user
  should let the program determine the columns used.
- The cols_used parameter is especially relevant when the user loads
  samples in an unorthodox way.
- The default read direction is vertical as indicated earlier.
- Users are advised NOT to supply the cols_used because the program has
  a robust algorithm for determining the cols_used. The users‚Äô input
  will override the inbuilt algorithm for determining columns used.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
dat2 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_2.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
n <- c('A','B','C')
c <- c(5,6,7)
normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat2, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, rows_used=n, cols_used=c)
```

| A5 (Test) | B5 (Negative) | C5 (Positive) | Cycle_No |
|:----------|:--------------|:--------------|:---------|
| A5        | B5            | C6            | 1        |
| A5        | B5            | C6            | 2        |
| A5        | B5            | C6            | 3        |

#### Using The user_specific_labels parameter

- If the user provides the user_specific_labels parameter then they
  CANNOT use the rows_used and cols_used parameter together OR the
  rows_used parameter alone. It is a trade-off where the user either
  lets the program generate column names for them or the user decides to
  take CONTROL and do it themselves.
- This user_specific_labels parameter is a proactive move from the user
  if the user had a complicated experimental setup that can lead to
  wrong attribute names.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
dat2 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_2.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
manual_cols <- c('A1','B1','C1')
normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat2, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, user_specific_labels = manual_cols)
```

- Hypothetically, if the user uses the rows and columns indicated in the
  examples in [Using The rows_used and cols_used
  parameter](#Using%20The%20rows_used%20and%20cols_used%20parameter) but
  skips some wells, then the user can simply go ahead and use the
  user_specific_labels to add the correct column names for the final
  data frame.

- However, if the scenario above occurs where the user indicates 9 wells
  should be used but the program detects fewer than 9 samples, then the
  program will inform the user and ask the user to choose from a list of
  column names. Illustration below:

| Sample_Type (TNP) | 96  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
|:------------------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| Test              | A   | X1  | X4  | X3  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Negative          | B   | X2  | X29 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Positive          | C   | X25 |     | X28 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | D   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | E   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | F   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

#### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èÔ∏è Using The read_direction parameter

- As indicated in all the previous examples, the default read direction
  is vertical and I have provided illustrations in the form of tables
  that shows the expected outcome.
- The read_direction can be indicated explicitly as vertical or left as
  NULL but must be indicated explicitly as horizontal to obtain a
  different outcome.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
dat2 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_2.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
manual_cols <- c('A1','B1','C1')
normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat2, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, n, read_direction = 'horizontal')
```

| Sample_Type (TNP) | 96  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
|:------------------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| Test              | A   | X1  | X2  | X3  | X4  | X5  | X6  | X7  | X8  | X9  | X10 | X11 | X12 |
| Negative          | B   | X13 | X14 | X15 | X16 | X17 | X18 | X19 | X20 | X21 | X22 | X23 | X24 |
| Positive          | C   | X25 | X26 | X27 | X28 | X29 | X30 | X31 | X32 | X33 | X34 | X35 | X36 |
|                   | D   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | E   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | F   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | G   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|                   | H   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

- The horizontal read direction means the final data frame is presented
  in the format below.

| A1 (Test) | A2 (Test) | A3 (Test) | Cycle_No |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:---------|
| A1        | A2        | A3        | 1        |
| A1        | A2        | A3        | 2        |
| A1        | A2        | A3        | 3        |
| A1        | A2        | A3        | 4        |
| A1        | A2        | A3        | 5        |
| A1        | A2        | A3        | 6        |
| A1        | A2        | A3        | ‚Ä¶38      |
| A1        | A2        | A3        | ‚Ä¶39      |
| A1        | A2        | A3        | ‚Ä¶40      |

#### Using The norm_scale parameter

- Just like the DBF procedure, I have provided a few options for
  normalization scales.
- My favorite is the z-score scale as it provides more clarity in
  thinking about the results.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
dat2 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_2.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
manual_cols <- c('A1','B1','C1')
normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat2, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, n, read_direction = 'horizontal', norm_scale = 'hundred')
```

## The Non-standard Experimental Setup

- Below is a look at the non-standard experimental setup.

| Sample_Type | 96  | Test | Negative | Positive | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
|:------------|:----|:-----|:---------|:---------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|             | A   | X1   | X2       | X3       | X4  | X5  | X6  | X7  | X8  | X9  | X10 | X11 | X12 |
|             | B   | X13  | X14      | X15      | X16 | X17 | X18 | X19 | X20 | X21 | X22 | X23 | X24 |
|             | C   | X25  | X26      | X27      | X28 | X29 | X30 | X31 | X32 | X33 | X34 | X35 | X36 |
|             | D   |      |          |          |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|             | E   |      |          |          |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|             | F   |      |          |          |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|             | G   |      |          |          |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|             | H   |      |          |          |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

- Below we take a look at what the machine sees.

| Sample_Type | Cycle_No | Machine_data_verbose | machine_data_numeric |
|:------------|:---------|:---------------------|:---------------------|
| Test-1      | 1        | A1                   | 1                    |
| Test-2      | 1        | B1                   | 2                    |
| Test-3      | 1        | C1                   | 3                    |
| Test-1      | 2        | A1                   | 4                    |
| Test-2      | 2        | B1                   | 5                    |
| Test-3      | 2        | C1                   | 6                    |
| Test-1      | 40       | A1                   | ‚Ä¶118                 |
| Test-2      | 40       | B1                   | ‚Ä¶119                 |
| Test-3      | 40       | C1                   | ‚Ä¶120                 |

- A keen observation below is that the vertical read direction in the
  program or package yields a final data frame that conceptually looks
  like the horizontal read direction with the test samples clustered as
  in the illustration below.
- Using the non-standard setup simply affects attribute naming
  conventions otherwise everything should be fine.

| A1 (Test-1) | B1 (Test-2) | C1 (Test-3) | Cycle_No |
|:------------|:------------|:------------|:---------|
| A1          | B1          | C1          | 1        |
| A1          | B1          | C1          | 2        |
| A1          | B1          | C1          | 3        |
| A1          | B1          | C1          | 4        |
| A1          | B1          | C1          | 5        |
| A1          | B1          | C1          | 6        |
| A1          | B1          | C1          | ‚Ä¶38      |
| A1          | B1          | C1          | ‚Ä¶39      |
| A1          | B1          | C1          | ‚Ä¶40      |

- Above is just a quick illustration of the non-standard setup. This
  setup does not change anything about the algorithms but simply
  showcases how naming conventions will reverse if the experimenter
  deviates from the commonly used path.

## ü•† Fail Safe DAT Procedure

- As indicated earlier, the code chunk below is the simplest use case
  for this function.
- AHOI, the user gets a data frame with the samples perfectly separated
  and WITH attribute names.
- Very important to mention this point twice.

``` r
library(normfluodbf)
dat1 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_1.dat", package = "normfluodbf")

normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat1, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, rows_used = c('A','B','C') )

# Use the syntax below to obtain a Time attribute as well
normalized_data <- normfluodat(dat1, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, rows_used = c('A','B','C'), interval = 30)
```

## ‚ú® Updates

``` r
#simple pipeline run
lipsum_214 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_1.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
   plate = setup_plate(init_plate())
   plate <- plate %>%
     upload_data(file = lipsum_214, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, rows_used = c('A','B','C'), norm_scale = 'raw') %>%
     run_steps

#subset and plot
lipsum_214 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_1.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
plate = setup_plate(init_plate())
plate <- plate %>%
  upload_data(file = lipsum_214, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, rows_used = c('A','B','C'), norm_scale = 'raw') %>%
  run_steps %>% subset('A1,B1,C1,C9') %>%
  plot(whichplot = 2, legend_labels = c('beef_jerky','fatnose','yourmamasofat','youweird'))

#plot plate layout- my favorite
lipsum_214 <- system.file("extdata", "dat_1.dat", package = "normfluodbf")
plate = setup_plate(init_plate())
plate <- plate %>%
  upload_data(file = lipsum_214, tnp = 3, cycles = 40, rows_used = c('A','B','C'), norm_scale = 'raw') %>%
  run_steps %>% subset_for_layout(c('A1', 'B1', 'C1','A2','B2','C2','A3','B3','C3','C12','C9')) %>% plot(whichplot = 3)
```

## üõÇ Quality Control (QC)

- Experimental issues should be investigated at very high or very low
  fluorescence values.

- The most common experimental issues arise when ACMA concentrations are
  out of the tolerated range. Based on my experience, ACMA
  concentrations between 2 and 5 Micromolar will suffice to get
  fluorescence values within the tolerance threshold.

- ACMA concentrations as low as 0.2 Micromolar or as high as 20
  Micromolar have proven problematic based on my research experience.
  These ACMA concentrations have proven NOISY and provide the basis for
  determining the noise-signal regions.

- Another issue linked to the FLUOstar instrument revolves around
  setting the right ‚Äúgain‚Äù to ensure the right level of sensitivity in
  machine readings. A very high ‚Äúgain‚Äù setting results in increased
  machine sensitivity even at the right ACMA concentrations and vice
  versa. In short, we want the machine to be primed to read exactly what
  we feed it, no more, no less.

- This program boasts of a quality control function to help new
  researchers avoid pitfalls that can mar their experience performing
  experiments.

- Within this package, a QC function is designed to check that
  fluorescence values do not exceed the upper limit (2^15 or 32768) OR
  fall below the lower limit (2^11 or 2048). Fluorescence values that
  exceed these thresholds are considered noisy and can lead to incorrect
  interpretation of analysis results.

- The images presented below represent results obtained when experiments
  are conducted within the noise region. The X-axis is actually
  ‚ÄúCycle_No‚Äù but seemed to have been mislabeled due to the tedious
  nature of my previous coding approach.

## üíª Visualization

- This time around, the package has a visualization function that is
  built on ggplot2.
- Users can expect to get some amazing visualizations using this
  function.
- Here are some visualizations from my seminar on this topic. These were
  done with base R and the images represent the results obtained when
  experiments are conducted within the signal region.

## üéá Epilogue

- It was interesting getting this package to maturity.
- Users are advised to default to the simplest use cases if they find
  the learning curve (LC) for the package too steep.
- I am almost certain there is always something to improve but I can say
  this package is officially complete based on the project scope.
